# Description

You are tired of congestions and waiting too long on the street to find affordable transportation to your home or work. Rakabny is here to help you. Scan all upcoming microbuses for empty places on your phone and reserve your seat comfortably right from where you were standing. 
The mobile application shows you the number of microbuses in your area and the number of available seats in them, thus you can book your seat easily and don't stand too much to ride thus saving money and time; it's extremely cheap compared to other alternatives, you only pay the same fees and the price of your order.
